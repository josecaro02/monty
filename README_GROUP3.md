## Objectives

-   What do LIFO and FIFO mean
-   What is a stack, and when to use it
-   What is a queue, and when to use it
-   What are the common implementations of stacks and queues
-   What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues
-   What is the proper way to use global variables

### LIFO
LIFO (Last In First Out) data structure of Stack– the data we have put in last is what we will get out first.

- Use: Suppose we are finding a path for solving maze problem. We choose a path and after following it we realize that it is wrong. Now we need to go back to the beginning of the path to start with new path. This can be done with the help of stack.
### FIFO
FIFO (First In First Out) data structure or Queue-  we add elements at the back and remove elements from the front. 

- Use: buffers for network communication that temporarily store packets of data arriving on a network port. Generally speaking, we want to process them in the order that they arrive.

### GLOBAL VARIABLES
Variables that are declared outside of a function block and can be accessed inside the function is called global variables.

- Avoiding global variables is preferred if the if the design and implementation naturally allows that, so use it if they are really needed.

## ACTIVITIES
- Read documentation.
- Review the different projects, finding different ways to solve problems about global variables and implementation of Stack.

## BOTTLENECKS
